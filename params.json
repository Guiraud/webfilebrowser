{"name":"Web File Browser","tagline":"Web File Browser","body":"Web File Browser\r\n================\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWeb File Browser is a simple open-source file browser written in PHP (1 single file)\r\nthat allows users to create, delete, edit, copy, rename, move and upload files and\r\ndirectories thru a light, full-text, web-based interface.\r\n\r\n![Web File Browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgdave/webfilebrowser/master/snapshot.jpg)\r\n\r\nUp-to-date version is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/cgdave/webfilebrowser).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nCopy the `wfb.php` file (and optionaly the two directories `wfbimages` and `wfbtrash`) to your target\r\ndirectory in your web server's document root.\r\n\r\nStart your favorite Web Browser and point to `http://yourserver.yourdomain/yourdirectory/wfb.php`.\r\n\r\nYou can also change the name of `wfb.php` to `index.php`so as it is considered as the index file of your directory\r\n(whichever his name this file wont appear).\r\n\r\nYou may also want to put some user information in the `wfbreadme.html`.\r\n\r\nCustomization\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWeb File Browser allows you to customize some features such as:\r\n\r\n- Use optional icons or only text\r\n- Title, colors, sizes, ...\r\n- Enable/disable links on files\r\n- Enable/disable file uploads\r\n- Customize list of extensions that allow files to be edited\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nLook at the source for optional customization.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWeb File Browser includes a builtin authentication (look at the source).\r\n\r\nYou can also rely on your web server for authentication. \r\n\r\nFor instance with Apache you can setup a `.htaccess` file like this:\r\n\r\n```plain\r\n<Files \"wfb.php\">\r\n   AuthType Basic\r\n   AuthUserFile \".htpasswd\"\r\n   AuthName \"webFileBrowser\"\r\n   Require valid-user\r\n</Files>\r\n```\r\n \r\nFAQ\r\n---\r\n\r\n### File upload does not work, what's wrong ?\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons for that : \r\n\r\n- First, check your `php.ini` : \r\n```\r\nfile_uploads = On \r\nupload_max_filesize = 2M \r\n```\r\n\r\nand verify that the value in `$uploadmaxsize` variable is the same as this value\r\n(for istance `2M` means 2 megabytes = 2097152 bytes) \r\n\r\n- Second, if you run your PHP-enabled web server under Linux/Unix, uploaded files (and created files/directories)\r\nare created under the ownership of the Unix user that runs your webserver. \r\nAs the PHP function `chown()` does not work unless this user is root (which is obviously a bad idea)\r\nit is not possible to chown files to another user after creation. \r\n\r\nA simple workaround is to `chown`/`chgrp` your directories to the web browser `user`/`group`, \r\n\r\nAnother workaround is to add the webbrowser group to the secondary groups of the user owner of the directories (that's what I do).\r\nIn that case remember to set `$filemode` to `0664` and $dirmode to `0775`. \r\n\r\n### URL upload does not work, what's wrong ? \r\n\r\nCheck your `php.ini` : \r\n\r\n```\r\nallow_url_fopen = On\r\n```\r\n\r\nand keep in mind that only URL explicitely pointing to a file (such as `http://myserver/myfile.txt`) can be URL-uploaded. \r\n\r\n### How do I hide files ? \r\n\r\nCustomize `$hidefilepattern` so as it contains a regular expression matching the name of the files you want to hide. \r\nAn example is given is the source to hide dot files. \r\n\r\n### Why delete action does not appear ? \r\n\r\nWhen you delete a file Web File Browser just move it into the trash can directory. This directory (located in the base directory)\r\nmust exists and be writeable, if not the delete button is inhibited. \r\n\r\nYou can customize its name using `$trashcan`. \r\n\r\n### Which web browsers are supported ? \r\n\r\nWeb File Browser has been tested on most browsers fro the last 10 years, it should work on yours ;-)\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n----\r\n\r\nSome features that might be developed one day:\r\n\r\n- Handling of multiple uploads\r\n- Zip/Unzip files and directories\r\n- Reorganization of the code and added comments\r\n\r\nInternationalization\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThanks to contributors, these language are supported:\r\n\r\n- English (corrected by Randall COHEN)\r\n- French\r\n- Spanish and Catalan thanks to Albert LOMBARTE\r\n- German thanks to Johannes EDER\r\n- Swedish thanks to Mikael WANBERG\r\n- Ukranian thanks to Dmytro KOVALOV\r\n- Dutch thanks to Luk VANLANDUYT\r\n- Norwegian thanks to Paul LOE\r\n- Finnish thanks to Petteri HIETAVIRTA\r\n- Turkish thanks to Tayfun BILSEL\r\n- Greek thanks to Balaskas EUAGGELOS\r\n- Polish thanks to Slawomir BROWKIN\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- Versions 0.1a, 0.2a and 0.3a were alpha versions not worth publishing...\r\n- Version 0.4b1 was first beta version.\r\n- Versions 0.4b2 and 0.4b3 fixed few bugs and added few sub-features\r\n- Versions 0.4b4, 0.4b5, 0.4b6 fixed few bugs and added trash can management\r\n- Version 0.4b7 added direct links to main directory and trash can and README file management\r\n- Version 0.4b8 fixed a few bugs, added file restore feature in trash can and added URL upload feature\r\n- Version 0.4b9 fixed a few bugs and added file aliasing feature\r\n- Version 0.4b10 added multilingual support\r\n- Version 0.4b11 fixed a few bugs regarding PHP warnings\r\n- Version 0.4b12 fixed issue with \"register_globals\", added search (thanks to Larry CHAFFIN for the idea) and download features, added images (thaks again Larry), added optionnal images, fixed few bugs\r\n- Version 0.4b13 reorganized PHP and generated HTML/Javascript code, added help messages in the status bar, added multiple file selection (also fixed few bugs) \r\n- Version 0.4b14 added profile management and other authentication methods, fixed some subtile bugs (thanks to Jean-Jacques LE MOUEL) \r\n- Version 0.4b15 migrated to GitHub, started modernization\r\n \r\nDisclaimer\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; \r\nwithout even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. \r\nSee the GNU General Public License for more details. \r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of \r\nthe GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation\r\n","google":"webfilebrowser","note":"Don't delete this file!
